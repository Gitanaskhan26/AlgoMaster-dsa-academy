## 📖 The Story

> *"I vibe coded this project for revision of DSA & Algorithms with proper C++ Syntax"*

This project was born out of a simple need — **a one-stop platform to revise everything related to Data Structures and Algorithms** before interviews, exams, or just to keep the concepts fresh.

As a developer preparing for technical interviews, I found myself jumping between multiple resources — YouTube videos, random GitHub repos, scattered notes, and textbooks. Nothing felt *right*. So I decided to build what I actually needed:

- 🎯 **70+ Algorithms** with clean C++ implementations
- 📚 **Theory explanations** that actually make sense
- 👶 **Step-by-step walkthroughs** explained in simple terms (not academic jargon)
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** that makes studying enjoyable, not painful
- ⚡ **Fast and responsive** — no waiting, no friction

This isn't just another boring algorithm cheat sheet. It's a **vibe-coded learning platform** built with modern web technologies and a focus on developer experience.
